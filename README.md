# jlox-but-in-cpp
A lox interpreter written in c++. I followed the jlox tutorial (chapters 4-13 from the [crafting interpreters book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html)) and translated the java code into c++. I am now in the stage of polishing, unit testing and fixing memory leaks.

This project was started to learn about designing and implementing a programming (scripting) language and to improve my c++ programming skills.
